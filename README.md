## About this Project

My first job totally done in flutter, done to bring all my work together in just one place.

Show my projects made in Flutter and my social networks.

## Why?
This project is part of my personal portfolio, so, I'll be happy if you could provide me any feedback about the project, code, structure or anything that you can report that could make me a better developer!

It's free!

You can send how many codes do you want, I'll be glad to analyse them! And if you have any question about the project...
